# windows-cmd-tools
Welcome to my collection of cmd tools, which are preinstalled as standard in Linux. This collection is designed to simplify the use of the Windows console (short for 'cmd'). It consists of both self-developed and third-party software, and is constantly expanding and updating. Installation instructions can be found in the wiki.
